**ABSTRACT**
To address the issues of insufficient population diversity and the tendency to fall into local convergence in the NSGA-II algorithm for distributed heterogeneous flexible job shop scheduling, a dual-population improved algorithm, D3QN-NSGA-II, based on D3QN is proposed. By introducing a dual-population evolution strategy, the breeding population and the regular population are divided using a reproductive capacity assessment mechanism, with differentiated crossover and mutation operators designed for each. A hybrid strategy, consisting of 12 types of local search operators across 3 categories, is constructed, and the innovative application of D3QN deep reinforcement learning for dynamic operator selection is introduced. Additionally, an energy-efficient scheduling strategy is applied to optimize machine idle time. Finally, the effectiveness of the D3QN-NSGA-II algorithm is evaluated using 20 instances, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over several other advanced algorithms in solving the DHFJS problem.
