**Abstract：**
Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is acknowledged as an anticipatory design methodology. In addressing the operational and maintenance challenges of complex equipment, particularly those capable of self-healing, a Prognostics and Health Management for Digital Twin (PHMDT) framework has been developed in this research. This framework, rooted in MBSE principles, targets digital twins and encompasses four key subsystems: Virtual-Real Mapping, Prediction, Visualization, and Strategy Development & Evaluation. These subsystems facilitate the seamless transition from stakeholder requirements to subsystem analysis and design. Illustrated within the MagicGrid framework, practical implementation scenarios within the PEMFC system are presented. Each proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) subsystem is meticulously crafted, leveraging monitoring matrices, refined characterization equations, bespoke state prediction models, and self-healing recovery strategy formulation. Through comprehensive visualization and integration, a robust PHM system is realized, affirming the efficacy and applicability of the PHMDT framework. The aim of this study is to propose a framework that is more suitable for collaborative PHM of complex equipment and to explore in detail the specific implementation structure of each subsystem in the health management of PEMFC.
