**Abstract：**
Under the dual pressure of energy conservation and environmental protection, the internal combustion engine industry is facing huge challenges, and it is imperative to find new clean energy. Hydrogen energy is expected to replace traditional fossil fuels as an excellent fuel for internal combustion engines because of its clean, continuous regeneration and good combustion performance. This review article focuses on the research and development of blended hydrogen-fuel internal combustion engines in China since the beginning of this century. The main achievements gained by Chinese researchers in performing research on the effects of the addition of hydrogen into engines, which predominantly include many types of hydrogen-blended engines such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and alcohol engines, rotary engines, are discussed and analyzed in these areas of the engine’s performance, and the combustion and emission characteristics, etc. The merits and demerits of blended hydrogen-fuel internal combustion engines could be concluded and summarized after discussion. Finally, the development trend and direction of exploration on hydrogen-fuel internal combustion engines could also be forecasted for relevant researchers.
