Abstract: Because of its superior cold-start effect and lack of pollution, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) engine has gained a lot of interest as the most common application type of hydrogen fuel cell engines. However, the difficulty in forecasting the remaining life and monitoring the operation state for a lengthy period limits its commercialization. As a result, PEMFC Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is critical. A method based on bibliometrics is introduced into the research on this topic. In this work, the research in this field is divided into three stages. The characteristics of different stages are summarized through keywords, subject background, and other aspects. We can observe the transformation of the field from the idea based on analytical reduction to systematic theoretical control. Based on the results of bibliometric analysis, we have conducted a literature review, and we can see the typical research results and development direction of each topic clustering.
